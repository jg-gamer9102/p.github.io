            <strong>The Tour</strong><br>
            The tour of the St. Patrick's Festival was long and exciting. The passion and enthusiasm of the participants were palpable, with costumes and accessories reflecting the festival's theme. The parade was impressive, with cheers of "Long live St. Patrick!" and a beautiful atmosphere.

            <strong>The New and the Familiar</strong><br>
            During the tour, I discovered new things and remembered others I already knew. I was particularly struck by how Catholicism was introduced to Ireland and how it became an important part of Irish culture. The museum was especially interesting as it talked about the history of the war between the United States and Venezuela, and how airplanes and weapons were used in the conflict.

            <strong>The Tribute to St. Patrick</strong><br>
            I was impressed by how St. Patrick and the Irish who fought for their freedom are honored. The story of St. Patrick and his use of the three-leaf clover to explain the mystery of the Holy Trinity is fascinating. I was also struck by how Irish nationalists used the green clover as a symbol of a free Ireland.
