    <p>Content Development<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Observations:</strong><br>
        During my visit to the St. Patrick's Festival, I observed how people gathered to celebrate this special day. I was struck by how everyone was dressed in green, with costumes and accessories reflecting the theme of the festival. I also heard the sound of bagpipes, which I found very relaxing and enjoyable.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Key Aspects:</strong><br>
        I consider the history behind the St. Patrick's Festival to be one of the most important aspects of the experience. I was impressed to learn about how this day was created to honor the help that the Irish gave to Mexico in its fight for independence. This story made me reflect on the importance of solidarity and cooperation between nations.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What Caught My Attention:</strong><br>
        What caught my attention the most were the bagpipes and the ancient weapons displayed at the museum. I was fascinated by how these weapons had been created with so much effort and dedication, and how they reflected the passion and craftsmanship of the time.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Relation to Course Content:</strong><br>
        Upon reflecting on my experience, I realized that what I observed directly relates to the content of the course. The Irish used the shamrock as a symbol of freedom and resistance against English slavery. This helped me understand better the importance of symbols and the history behind them.
